# Problem-LinkedListCSharp
C# Linked List problem for current and future students to solve.

A linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a list. Under
the simplest form, each node is composed of some data and a link to the next node in the list. The
principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can easily be inserted
or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure, because the data items need
not be stored contiguously in memory.

In this assignment, you will create a doubly linked list with head and tail pointers. The comments for
each of the methods will tell you what needs to be done.
